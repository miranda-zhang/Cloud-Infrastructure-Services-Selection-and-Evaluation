The proliferation of cloud computing has revolutionized the hosting and delivery of Internet-based application services. However, with the constant increase of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big companies (e.g., Amazon Web Service and Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g. Rackspace and FlexiScale), decision makers such as application developers and chief information officers are likely to be overwhelmed by various choices available. In this talk, I will introduce the works I have carried out to address the above problem.  As an outcome, an extensible, ontology-based and multi-criteria decision aid system is developed for infrastructure service discovery and selection. This system builds on the well-known analytic hierarchy process method. So it allows users to define multiple design-time constraints, e.g. renting cost, data center location, service feature, etc., and real-time constraints, such as end-to-end message latency and throughput. These constraints are then matched against our knowledge base to compute the possible best-fit combinations of cloud Infrastructure, offered as a Service (IaaS).
