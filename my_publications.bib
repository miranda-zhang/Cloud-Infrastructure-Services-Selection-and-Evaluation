abstract = {Most universities offer a program of transferable skills for doctoral candidates - but is there much evidence to support that these programs really add value? Evaluating the utility of non-disciplinary, non-compulsory education offerings is extremely difficult. While it is easy to measure candidate engagement and satisfaction with individual workshops, it is much harder to see if these have any noticeable effect on other program outcomes, like retention and time to completion. This paper reports on a suite of innovative approaches to the problem of measuring the efficacy of transferable skills programs for doctoral candidates. Three methods were used to assess the long term impact of the ‘Thesis Bootcamp' program, which has been running at the Australian National University for three years. The methods included three new analysis methods adapted from ‘big data' approaches: matched pairs analysis, survival analysis and social network analysis. In an environment of increasing pressure on university resources, it is essential to find ways to prove value of resources committed to non-compulsory training programs. While some of these methods are extremely difficult to implement, they show a lot of promise as a way to demonstrate impact, beyond simple metrics around satisfaction and engagement.},

@article{AHP2015,
abstract = {The proliferation of cloud computing has revolutionized the hosting and delivery of Internet-based application services. However, with the constant launch of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (e.g., Amazon Web Service and Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g., Rackspace and Ninefold), decision makers (e.g., application developers and chief information officers) are likely to be overwhelmed by choices available. The decision-making problem is further complicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application provisioning QoS constraints. To address this hard challenge, in our previous work, we developed a semiautomated, extensible, and ontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection only based on design-time constraints (e.g., the renting cost, the data center location, the service feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our approach to include the real-time (run-time) QoS (the end-to-end message latency and the end-to-end message throughput) in the decision-making process. The hosting of next-generation applications in the domain of online interactive gaming, large-scale sensor analytics, and real-time mobile applications on cloud services necessitates the optimization of such real-time QoS constraints for meeting service-level agreements. To this end, we present a real-time QoS-aware multicriteria decision-making technique that builds over the well-known analytic hierarchy process method. The proposed technique is applicable to selecting Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offers, and it allows users to define multiple design-time and real-time QoS constraints or requirements. These requirements are then matched against our knowledge base to compute the possible best fit combinations of cloud services at the IaaS layer. We conducted extensive experiments to prove the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Although Cloud computing emerged for business applications in industry, public Cloud services have been widely accepted and encouraged for scientific computing in academia. The recently available Google Compute Engine (GCE) is claimed to support high-performance and computationally intensive tasks, while little evaluation studies can be found to reveal GCE's scientific capabilities. Considering that fundamental performance benchmarking is the strategy of early-stage evaluation of new Cloud services, we followed the Cloud Evaluation Experiment Methodology (CEEM) to benchmark GCE and also compare it with Amazon EC2, to help understand the elementary capability of GCE for dealing with scientific problems. The experimental results and analyses show both potential advantages of, and possible threats to applying GCE to scientific computing. For example, compared to Amazon's EC2 service, GCE may better suit applications that require frequent disk operations, while it may not be ready yet for single VM-based parallel computing. Following the same evaluation methodology, different evaluators can replicate and/or supplement this fundamental evaluation of GCE. Based on the fundamental evaluation results, suitable GCE environments can be further established for case studies of solving real science problems.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a new paradigm shift which enables applications and related content (audio, video, text, images, etc.) to be provisioned in an on-demand manner and being accessible to anyone anywhere in the world without the need for owning expensive computing and storage infrastructures. Interactive multimedia content-driven applications in the domains of healthcare, aged-care, and education have emerged as one of the new classes of big data applications. This new generation of applications need to support complex content operations including production, deployment, consumption, personalization, and distribution. However, to efficiently provision these applications on the Cloud data centres, there is a need to understand their runtime resource configurations. For example: (i) where to store and distribute the content to and from driven by end-user Service Level Agreements (SLAs)? (ii) How many content distribution servers to provision? And (iii) what Cloud VM configuration (number of instances, types, speed, etc.) to provision? In this paper, we present concepts and factors related to engineering such content-driven applications over public Clouds. Based on these concepts and factors, we propose a performance evaluation methodology for quantifying and understanding the runtime configuration of these classes of applications. Finally, we conduct several benchmark driven experiments for validating the feasibility of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {The Cloud infrastructure services landscape advances steadily leaving users in the agony of choice. As a result, Cloud service identification and discovery remains a hard problem due to different service descriptions, non- standardised naming conventions and heterogeneous types and features of Cloud services. In this paper, analysis the research challenges and present a Web Ontology Language (OWL) based ontology, the Cloud Computing Ontology (CoCoOn). It includes functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We also present a system, CloudRecommender, that implements our domain ontology in a relational model. The system uses regular expressions and Structured Query Language (SQL) for matching user requests to service descriptions. We brie y describe the architecture of the CloudRecommender system, and demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability through a service configuration selection experiment based on a set of prominent Cloud providers' descriptions including Amazon, Azure, and GoGrid.},
