title={Virtual Machine Provisioning Based on Analytical Performance and QoS in Cloud Computing Environments}, 
year={2011}, 
month={9}, 
pages={295-304}, 
abstract={Cloud computing is the latest computing paradigm that delivers IT resources as services in which users are free from the burden of worrying about the low-level implementation or system administration details. However, there are significant problems that exist with regard to efficient provisioning and delivery of applications using Cloud-based IT resources. These barriers concern various levels such as workload modeling, virtualization, performance modeling, deployment, and monitoring of applications on virtualized IT resources. If these problems can be solved, then applications can operate more efficiently, with reduced financial and environmental costs, reduced under-utilization of resources, and better performance at times of peak load. In this paper, we present a provisioning technique that automatically adapts to workload changes related to applications for facilitating the adaptive management of system and offering end-users guaranteed Quality of Services (QoS) in large, autonomous, and highly dynamic environments. We model the behavior and performance of applications and Cloud-based IT resources to adaptively serve end-user requests. To improve the efficiency of the system, we use analytical performance (queueing network system model) and workload information to supply intelligent input about system requirements to an application provisioner with limited information about the physical infrastructure. Our simulation-based experimental results using production workload models indicate that the proposed provisioning technique detects changes in workload intensity (arrival pattern, resource demands) that occur over time and allocates multiple virtualized IT resources accordingly to achieve application QoS targets.},

year={2013}, 
month={6}, 
pages={99-106}, 
abstract={Data centers, serving as infrastructures for cloud services, are growing in both number and scale. However, they usually consume enormous amounts of electric power, which lead to high operational costs of cloud service providers. Reducing the operational cost of data centers thus has been recognized as a main challenge in cloud computing. In this paper we study the minimum operational cost problem of fair request rate allocations in a distributed cloud environment by incorporating the diversity of time-varying electricity prices in different regions, with an objective to fairly allocate requests to different data centers for processing while keeping the negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between request users and the cloud service provider to be met, where the data centers and web portals of a cloud service provider are geographically located in different regions. To this end, we first propose an optimization framework for the problem. We then devise a fast approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio by exploiting combinatorial properties of the problem. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through experimental simulation on real-life electricity price data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very promising, which not only outperforms other existing heuristics but also is highly scalable.},

We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria.},

Ontologies are often used in industry to capture the conceptual information models underpinning applications. We start by describing the role that such models play in two use cases in the manufacturing and energy production sectors. Then, we discuss the formalisation of information models using ontologies, and the relevant reasoning services. Finally, we present SOMM-a tool that supports engineers with little background on semantic technologies in the creation of ontology-based models and in populating them with data. SOMM implements a fragment of OWL 2 RL extended with a form of integrity constraints for data validation, and it comes with support for schema and data reasoning, as well as for model integration. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the adequacy of SOMM's functionality and performance.},

abstract={Recently, the computational requirements for large scale data-intensive analysis of scientific data have grown significantly. In High Energy Physics (HEP) for example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produced 13 petabytes of data in 2010. This huge amount of data are processed on more than 140 computing centers distributed across 34 countries. The MapReduce paradigm has emerged as a highly successful programming model for large-scale data-intensive computing applications. However, current MapReduce implementations are developed to operate on single cluster environments and cannot be leveraged for large-scale distributed data processing across multiple clusters. On the other hand, workflow systems are used for distributed data processing across data centers. It has been reported that the workflow paradigm has some limitations for distributed data processing, such as reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of GHadoop, a MapReduce framework that aims to enable large-scale distributed computing across multiple clusters. G-Hadoop uses the Gfarm file system as an underlying file system and executes MapReduce tasks across distributed clusters. Experiments of the G-Hadoop framework on distributed clusters show encouraging results.},

@article{DecisionMakingParadox,
abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study that compared four decision-making methods. The methods examined were the weighted sum model, the weighted product model, the analytic hierarchy process, and the revised analytic hierarchy process. Two evaluative criteria were used in an attempt to find the best method. The first criterion was to see if the method when accurate in a multi-dimensional situation remained accurate in a single-dimension case. The second criterion determined the stability of a method in yielding the same outcome when a nonoptimal alternative was replaced with a worse alternative. Tests were conducted using simulated decision problems where random numbers were used for the values of the many combinations of alternatives and criteria. The results illustrate the paradox of deciding on a single best decision-making method. While this paradox is not resolved, useful information is presented for comparing the four methods tested.},

@article{VIKORformula,
abstract = {The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods VIKOR and TOPSIS are all based on an aggregating function representing “closeness to the ideal”, which originated in the compromise programming method. The VIKOR method of compromise ranking determines a compromise solution, providing a maximum “group utility” for the “majority” and a minimum of an “individual regret” for the “opponent”, which is an effective tool in multi-criteria decision making, particularly in a situation where the decision maker is not able, or does not know to express his/her preference at the beginning of system design. The TOPSIS method determines a solution with the shortest distance to the ideal solution and the greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution, but it does not consider the relative importance of these distances. And, the hesitant fuzzy set is a very useful tool to deal with uncertainty, which can be accurately and perfectly described in terms of the opinions of decision makers. In this paper, we develop the E-VIKOR method and TOPSIS method to solve the MCDM problems with hesitant fuzzy set information. Firstly, the hesitant fuzzy set information and corresponding concepts are described, and the basic essential of the VIKOR method is introduced. Then, the problem on multiple attribute decision marking is described, and the principles and steps of the proposed E-VIKOR method and TOPSIS method are presented. Finally, a numerical example illustrates an application of the E-VIKOR method, and the result by the TOPSIS method is compared.},

abstract={Cloud computing systems fundamentally provide access to large pools of data and computational resources through a variety of interfaces similar in spirit to existing grid and HPC resource management and programming systems. These types of systems offer a new programming target for scalable application developers and have gained popularity over the past few years. However, most cloud computing systems in operation today are proprietary, rely upon infrastructure that is invisible to the research community, or are not explicitly designed to be instrumented and modified by systems researchers. In this work, we present Eucalyptus - an open-source software framework for cloud computing that implements what is commonly referred to as infrastructure as a service (IaaS); systems that give users the ability to run and control entire virtual machine instances deployed across a variety physical resources. We outline the basic principles of the Eucalyptus design, detail important operational aspects of the system, and discuss architectural trade-offs that we have made in order to allow EUCALYPTUS to be portable, modular and simple to use on infrastructure commonly found within academic settings. Finally, we provide evidence that EUCALYPTUS enables users familiar with existing grid and HPC systems to explore new cloud computing functionality while maintaining access to existing, familiar application development software and grid middleware.},

In a discovery process, a trader proposes available Web services as potential candidates. In a succeeding selection, for each task a trader chooses one candidate to form the optimal composition due to selection criteria. This paper discusses how the selection can consider different quality-of-service (QoS) categories to determine the most suitable candidates for the composition. If more than one category is used for optimisation, a multi-dimensional optimisation problem arises. This mentions similarities to similar combinatorial problems. Then, possible solutions are proposed and their performance is evaluated.},

@article{CSO,
abstract = {Cloud federation systems have recently emerged as a scalable delivery model that interconnects services from two or more cloud providers for load balancing and accommodating spikes in demand. One challenge in this delivery model is the complexity of service selection due to the heterogeneity of cloud service descriptions among cloud federations. To overcome this complexity, it is crucial to uniform cloud service descriptions. Towards this end, we propose a Cloud Service description Ontology (CSO) that will be modeled based on concepts from cloud standards. The proposed CSO covers functional and non-functional capabilities of infrastructure, platform and software services' providers. To pop-ulate CSO, we defined a set of semantic mapping rules to collect instances from cloud providers' web pages. In addition, to ensure the high quality of CSO, we propose an evaluation approach that detects and corrects consistency, re-dundancy and incompleteness errors. Furthermore, to show the correctness and inference ability of CSO, we present an experimental evaluation that measures the precision and recall ratios of querying CSO.},

@article{CSRecommender,
abstract = {Cloud Computing and in particular cloud services have become widely used in both the technology and business industries. Despite this significant use, very little research or commercial solutions exist that focus on the discovery of cloud services. This paper introduces CSRecommender—a search engine and recommender system specifically designed for the discovery of these services. To engineer the system to scale, we also describe the implementation of a Cloud Service Identifier which enables the system to crawl the Internet without human involvement. Finally, we examine the effectiveness and usefulness of the system using real-world use cases and users.},

@article{FormalizingInformalConceptMappingAndSemanticWeb,
abstract = {Concept Maps are seen as ways to conceptualize domains that can be comprehended within the human attention span, and are often based on terminologies arising in technical, scientific or engineering domains. We report on a set of related projects that go beyond this tradition in two ways: by connecting CmapTools to the new, machine-processable standard notations for formal Web meta-data (RDF and OWL), and by applying the resulting tools to the construction of Web markup for works of art. This domain provides a semantically-rich case study because descriptions of artwork inherently contain a mix of artifacts, some of which can easily be formalized (creator, title, creation date, etc.) and some of which express meanings about the work that are more difficult to formalize. Formalization of knowledge about works of art could benefit web developers by giving greater organization to these types of resources on the internet. It will also help foster the development of ontologies in other, similarly rich and challenging domains. A CmapTools extension called CmapTools Ontology Editor (COE) translates RDF and OWL to and from Concept Maps, providing a bridge between the worlds of human-oriented Concept Mapping and machine-oriented formal inference. Because of the strengths in CmapTools to provide a specific method for capturing meanings and concepts, we believe that the COE extension can provide the means for formalizing this conceptually challenging domain that involves an artist's interpretation of the intentions and motivations behind their artwork.},

@article{AgentSOAServicesDiscovery,
abstract = {Cloud Computing is becoming gradually more important. Cloud Computing is an integrated model of hardware, software, and middleware that has been provided as a service. Cloud services (CSs) facilitate the use and reuse of Cloud Computing layers as a service. Cloud Computing layers are broadly classified into Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Shortly, CSs delivered and consumed across internet. One of the critical limitations of a newly Cloud Computing customers is the lack of available efficient search engines. It is more applicable to use widely available CSs that might be higher in quality than to use CSs that do not match the desired user requirements. Current search engines do not offer efficient search capabilities and results. To address these shortages, a proposed Cloud Services Discovery Framework (CSDF) is presented to highlight the discovering and utilizing of CSs provided by different Cloud Services Providers. CSDF combines the functionality of software agents and web services. Software agents have the capabilities of operating as standalone process and performing actions without user intervene. While web services needs intervene to be operated. In CSDF, Software Agents are Crawler, Analyzer, Evaluator, Tracker, Recommender, and Ranker agents. CSDF Web services are Cloud Service Manager (CSM), Query Manager (QM), Query Processor Manager (QPM), and User Profile Manager (UPM).},

@article{Ontology-basedAnnotationRetrievalOfServicesInCloud,
abstract = {Cloud computing is a technological paradigm that permits computing services to be offered over the Internet. This new service model is closely related to previous well-known distributed computing initiatives such as Web services and grid computing. In the current socio-economic climate, the affordability of cloud computing has made it one of the most popular recent innovations. This has led to the availability of more and more cloud services, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly difficult for service consumers to find and access those cloud services that fulfil their requirements. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced platform that will assist in the process of discovering the cloud services that best match user needs. This fully-fledged system encompasses two basic functions: the creation of a repository with the semantic description of cloud services and the search for services that accomplish the required expectations. The cloud service's semantic repository is generated by means of an automatic tool that first annotates the cloud service descriptions with semantic content and then creates a semantic vector for each service. The comprehensive evaluation of the tool in the ICT domain has led to very promising results that outperform state-of-the-art solutions in similarly broad domains.},

The purpose of this paper is to suggest a decision model for cloud computing deployment. To that end, this paper uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and benefit-cost-opportunity-risk (BCOR) analysis to select the best cloud computing deployment model with a holistic view based on the benefit, cost, opportunity, and risk factors. The results of this study will be useful for managers who have the intention to adopt cloud computing for their organization.},

In particular, QoS solutions are provided for unstructured conditional and loop patterns. We also show how QoS-based service selection can be conducted based on the proposed QoS calculation.

In particular, the creation of value-added services by composition of existing ones is gaining a significant momentum. Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different quality of service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service. Two selection approaches are described and compared: one based on local (task-level) selection of services and the other based on global allocation of tasks to services using integer programming.},

@article{CloudGenius,
abstract = {With the increase in cloud service providers, and the increasing number of compute services offered, a migration of information systems to the cloud demands selecting the best mix of compute services and virtual machine (VM ) images from an abundance of possibilities. Therefore, a migration process for web applications has to automate evaluation and, in doing so, ensure that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met, while satisfying conflicting selection criteria like throughput and cost. When selecting compute services for multiple connected software components, web application engineers must consider heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies across multiple layers, which is impossible to resolve manually. The previously proposed CloudGenius framework has proven its capability to support migrations of single-component web applications. In this paper, we expand on the additional complexity of facilitating migration support for multi-component web applications. In particular, we present an evolutionary migration process for web application clusters distributed over multiple locations, and clearly identify the most important criteria relevant to the selection problem. Moreover, we present a multi-criteria-based selection algorithm based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Because the solution space grows exponentially, we developed a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to cope with computational complexities in a growing cloud market. Furthermore, a use case example proofs CloudGenius' applicability. To conduct experiments, we implemented CumulusGenius, a prototype of the selection algorithm and the GA deployable on hadoop clusters. Experiments with CumulusGenius give insights on time complexities and the quality of the GA.},
